# Refinitiv Data Platform Library for Python

## Summary

The following series of examples demonstrate how to programmatically access content residing within the **Refinitiv Data Platform** using a single, ease of use library called the **Refinitiv Data Platform Library for Python**.  The platform refers to the layer of data services providing both streaming and non-streaming content serving different clients, from the simple desktop interface to the enterprise application.  

The Refinitiv Data Platform Library for Python is structured as a stack of interfaces and libraries designed to foster the adoption of our platform by both financial coders and professional developers to programmatically access financial content.  Based on this stack of interfaces, the examples defined within this section have been organized as follows:

### **Function**

The *Function* examples target simple functions that every financial coder can use to easily retrieve financial items like Price, News, Historical Data, etc. The *Function* layer is generally used for use cases that do not require advanced programming technics.

### **Content**

The *Content* examples target higher-level abstractions representing financial items like Price, News, Historical Data, etc. The *Content* layer can easily be used by both professional developers and financial coders. It provides great flexibility for commonly used financial objects.

### **Delivery**

The *Delivery* examples target the interfaces defined within the lowest abstraction layer of the library.  The examples will use different delivery modes such as Streaming, Data, Alert and Bulk services.
